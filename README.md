# Disney Memory Challenge
A fun Disney twist on the classic Memory / Concentration game! Players click through the grid and attempt to find two matching tiles for each Disney Character. If the two selected tiles aren't a match, the tiles flip back over and the player must guess again. As matches are made, the number of matches count in the "Scoreboard" panel will update and the corresponding character thumbnail in the "Find Me!" panel fade out to indicate that character was found. To win the game, the player must match all 12 characters!

## Technologies Used
1. VS Code: Used to create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
2. Adobe Illustrator: Used to create the default Mickey background image on all the tiles
3. HTML: for basic structure
4. CSS: adds layout, styling, and animations
5. JavaScript: adds match/win logic, the ability to shuffle tiles around with each game, and styling based on game state
